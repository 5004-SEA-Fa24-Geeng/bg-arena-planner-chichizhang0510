How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)?

- 10 hours.

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what
capacity.

- No.
  
Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)

- No.

(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?

- The TDD part. This is an interesting experience.

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?

- The filtering logic was unclear initially. It took time to understand which attributes (e.g., rating, difficulty) could be filtered and what operations (>=, <=, !=, etc.) were allowed. Some test cases expected string-based filtering (e.g., name == "Catan"), but it wasn't explicitly stated in the instructions.
- I will clearly define which attributes are filterable and which operations are allowed and provide examples of valid and invalid filter queries:
Maybe it is better to mention that filters are case-insensitive when filtering game names.
